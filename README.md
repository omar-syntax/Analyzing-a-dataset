# Analysis of Big Data Set with Data Scraping



## Abstract

#### This document provides an overview of the analysis conducted on a large dataset, detailing the methodologies employed, including data scraping techniques. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, leveraging various tools and frameworks to process and visualize the data effectively. This README serves as a guide for understanding the project structure, the data sources utilized, and the results obtained from the analysis.



## Project Overview

#### This project focuses on analyzing a substantial dataset obtained through data scraping. The goal was to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that could inform decision-making processes. The dataset encompasses various attributes that are crucial for the analysis.



## Data Sources

#### The primary data source for this analysis was obtained through web scraping. The following tools and libraries were utilized:



<ul>
  <li>Beautiful Soup: For parsing HTML and XML documents.</li>



  <li>Requests: For making HTTP requests to retrieve web pages.</li>



  <li>Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.</li>


</ul>



## Methodology
